                                               1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the streaming application, similar to Netflix. It encompasses both functional and non-functional requirements, and serves as a guideline for developers, testers, and stakeholders throughout the software development lifecycle.

1.2 Scope
The streaming application is an entertainment platform that enables users to stream movies, TV shows, and other video content via a web or mobile application. The system will manage user registration, content browsing, playback, subscription management, and recommendations. This SRS covers all aspects of the application, including user interfaces, functional and non-functional requirements, and external interface requirements.

The system will be built using a modular architecture to facilitate scalability and maintainability.

2.2 Product Functions

User registration and authentication
Content browsing and search
Video playback
Subscription management
Personalized recommendations
Parental controls and content restrictions
User ratings and reviews

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

Viewers: Individuals using the app to stream content.
Content Providers: Individuals or studios providing content for the platform.
Admins: Individuals managing the platform, overseeing user and content management.

2.4 Operating Environment

The application will operate on web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile platforms (iOS and Android). It will require internet connectivity for real-time functionalities like streaming, payment processing, and content updates. The backend will be hosted on cloud servers with high availability and reliability.

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

Must comply with digital rights management (DRM) regulations.
Limited by the performance and capabilities of web and mobile devices.
Dependency on third-party services for content delivery and recommendations.

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

Users have access to devices with stable internet connections.
Integration with third-party services for CDN and recommendations is stable and reliable.
The application will initially support multiple languages and currencies.
